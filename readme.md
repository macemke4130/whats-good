My favorite tech stack for creating new projects. This is a boilerplate intended to speed up project development.

After Git Init and "First Commit" and Push, run these commands in your CLI to deploy:
    - heroku create
    - git push heroku master
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Deploy"
    - git push heroku master
